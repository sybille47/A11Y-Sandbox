# Solo-project: A11Y-Sandbox

The app guides through accessibility features based on WCAG 2.1 explaining what accessibility is and why it matters. To limit the scope, examples for three categories of accessibility features would be shown:
1. Visual accessibility
2. Keyboard navigation
3. Navigation for users with mobility issues.
In addition, the app would include a section tools for creating accessible apps such as Lighhouse/specific dev tools, and a 'Reference' section for further reading and a glossary.
The user is guided through different sections that provide information and examples on creating accessible web sites, similar to a course in a LMS. The sections should include
1. short information on the feature
2. an example of the user experience without, with medium and with good accessibililty features considered. Since a lot of other sources of information on accessibility only provide descriptions and high level examples, this would provide the user with a better understanding of the user experience. The user should be able to interactively try out the different accessibility levels in examples provided to be able to compare and experience them directly. In order to provide this, examples should be embedded in the website and the user should switch/toggle between designs, e.g. with different contrast ratios, use a screen reader on a section without/ with good accessibilty features etc. Examples of input forms should provide an example of how input of data can be made more or less accessible. These input forms can also be used to show best practices for users with mobility issues (e.g. how buttons are positioned etc.), and would allow to add CRUD operations into the project. Where applicable, the examples should have snippets on best practices for the code (e.g. which HTML elements to use vs which are not picked up well by screen readers). The app should be responsive and work on different screen sizes, but the MVP would be for the web.
