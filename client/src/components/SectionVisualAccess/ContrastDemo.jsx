                  Color contrast is important for users to distinguish various text
                  and nonâ€“text elements. Higher contrast makes the imagery easier to
                  see, while lowâ€“contrast images may be difficult for some users to
                  differentiate in bright or low light conditions, such as on a very
                  sunny day or at night.

                  Contrast ratios represent how different one color is from another,
                  commonly written as 1:1 or 21:1. The greater the difference is
                  between the two numbers in the ratio, the greater the difference
                  in relative luminance between the colors...
