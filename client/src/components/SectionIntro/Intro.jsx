                  Accessible content is available, and its functionality can be operated by literally anyone.

                  Disabilities or situations can make it necessary to consider how all types of users can best use a product.
                  Challenges / disabilities can be categorised as permanent, temporary, and situational.
                </p>
                <p><em>Permanent</em></p>
                  <p>Permanent disabilities are disabilities that will not change or get better over a period of time.</p>
                <p><em>Temporary</em></p>
                  <p>Temporary disabilities are disabilities that will change or get better over time, such as recovering from a sports injury.</p>
                <p><em>Situational</em></p>
                  <p>Situational disabilities are disabilities that
                  wouldnâ€™t normally be called disability, but they are scenarios
                  where one needs similar accommodations as someone with a
                  permanent or temporary disability such as using a phone one-handed while holding a baby.</p>
